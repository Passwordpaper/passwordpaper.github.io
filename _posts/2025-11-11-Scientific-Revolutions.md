After my grandfather mentioned it a few times, I finally checked out a copy of The Structure of Scientific Revolutions by Thomas Kuhn. This essay is over 100 pages of exceedingly clear-eyed deconstruction of the practice of science as it is actually performed. There is a view of science which is the thing where you decide what is models of the world are correct by making predictions using those models and doing experiements to see if your predictions are correct. This is a powerful tool for truth-finding, but it so happens that there is too much truth in the world for a single person to know it all, and so science in practice is a community of people doing experiments. Kuhn addresses the dynamics of this community.

Kuhn's core idea is that most science is performed under what he calls a "paradigm," which is a set of models which define a realm of scientific inquiry. He is interested in how those paradigms are replaced as scientists find that old models are not up to the task of describing the universe. I think the most interesting part of the essay is not actually the mechanics of revolution, but the paradigm of scientific paradigms itself.
