I recently received an English translation of Tomihiko Morimi's The Tatami Galaxy. The book inspired an animated television series by the same name directed by Masaaki Yuasa, which currently has a place in my heart as the best piece of television I recall watching. Each chapter of the book and each episode of the anime follow the socially awkward protagonist through a different version of the college social life he could have had if he had become mainly involved with a particular club.

Having read the book now, I would like to put the TV series at the top of my internal list of well-executed adaptations, perhaps second only to Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings. The thing that makes Jackson's movies so good is that he shamelessly butchered the source material to bring the setting of Middle Earth and the themes of the original books to movies which people actually want to watch. The book series, for all that it has inspired generations of fantasy enthusiasts, rambles around the most understated documentary of a war. Jackson combs the books for things which he could make into epic spectacle or tense conflict, adds lighting and a soundtrack to get you emotionally invested in the whole thing, and turns the characters into caricatures of themselves to reduce any confusion about what they do for the story. He isn't above getting rid of characters with extreme plot relevance to the books entirely or brewing up a non-existent love story out of throwaway lines. His mission is to take all of the inspiration sparked by a set of books which are difficult for the modern consumer to actually read, fan it into an inferno, and inject it directly into the viewer's veins. People who haven't really interacted in any other way with the genre of high fantasy still love The Lord of the Rings movies. A nerd obsessed with DND could for decades explain themselves to anyone with even a toe in the common culture by saying "it's kind of like we're acting out a story in the Lord of the Rings universe together."

Morimi's novel is far easier to read than Tolkien's books, but Yuasa's take adds to the story. There are more episodes in the show than chapters in the book, but only a couple do not have some sort of basis in one of the book chapters. Some chapters have enough misadventures to be split up into multiple timelines, and the background absurdity of the college campus the characters provides enough detail to tease out new stories when necessary. The show is in some ways more difficult to watch than the novel is to read. The narrater speaks at a rapid clip, and little cartoons with words flash up between some scenes, so if you're trying to read subtitles, you might want to pause the show to read the text and then replay the scenes to enjoy the animation. Much of the protagonist's frustration is sexual, and at times the show becomes flat out uncomfortable for me to watch, whereas the subtlety of the book keeps the more visceral discomfort at arms' length. The animation is constantly switching up styles, sometimes having flat backgrounds in the style of the characters, sometimes switching to what looks like slightly blurred photorealistic video with a distorted color palette, and sometimes switching to flat abstract pictures with no linework. The show is disorienting, both in terms of unexplained details of the world popping out of the woodwork which don't get explained for several episodes and also in the sheer chaos of how many things are flashing on the screen. Despite these difficulties, the show manages to drag out a moral from the story that is harder to tease out of the book protagonist's inner monologue. The show is many things, but not subtle. The protagonist is struck with deja vu, often skirting close to the fourth wall in callbacks to previous episodes he should have no knowledge of. The book protagonist refuses to admit that his earlier misadventures were a life well lived once his life inevitably takes a turn for the better, whereas the animated protagonist verbally resolves to stop pining after lives he could have led and enjoy the one he has.
