I recently received an English translation of Tomihiko Morimi's The Tatami Galaxy. The book inspired an animated television series by the same name directed by Masaaki Yuasa, which currently has a place in my heart as the best piece of television I recall watching. Each chapter of the book and each episode of the anime follow the protagonist through a different version of the college social life he could have had if he had become mainly involved with a particular club.

Having read the book now, I would like to put the TV series at the top of my internal list of well-executed adaptations, perhaps second only to Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings. The thing that makes Jackson's movies so good is that he shamelessly butchered the source material to bring the setting of Middle Earth and the themes of the original books to movies which people actually want to watch. The book series, for all that it has inspired generations of fantasy enthusiasts, rambles around the most understated documentary of a war. Jackson combs the books for things which he could make into epic spectacle or tense conflict, adds lighting and a soundtrack to get you emotionally invested in the whole thing, and turns the characters into caricatures of themselves to reduce any confusion about what they do for the story. He isn't above getting rid of characters with extreme plot relevance to the books entirely or brewing up a non-existent love story out of throwaway lines. His mission is to take all of the inspiration sparked by a set of books which are difficult for the modern consumer to actually read, fan them into an inferno, and inject them directly into the viewer's veins. People who haven't really interacted in any other way with the genre of high fantasy still love The Lord of the Rings movies. A nerd obsessed with DND could for decades explain themselves to anyone with even a toe in the common culture by saying "it's kind of like we're acting out a story in the Lord of the Rings universe together."

The only reason that I can't give more credit to Yuasa for his adapatation of The Tatami Galaxy is that the original is far easier to read.
