title: 'Wind and Truth and good media which doesn't justify its length'
---

This is a blog, so I guess I can write about my life. I got a really bad resperatory infection in early January. I was stuck at home for a little over a week with very little ability to do anything but [consume media](https://passwordpaper.com/The-Tatami-Galaxy-and-the-Art-of-Adaptation/). For those that care, I seemed to get better, but kept coughing until I suddenly started coughing a lot and had horrible chest pain. That was how I ended up with at least one broken rib and another round of antibiotics. Anyway, I'm doing better now, so here's a blogpost.

One of the things I did while sick was read Brandon Sanderson's latest installment in his Stormlight Archive series. It is called Wind and Truth, it is over 1300 pages long, and I've decided that I didn't like it that much. It was entertaining enough, and one of the storylines was fine, but it wasn't worth the wordcount.
