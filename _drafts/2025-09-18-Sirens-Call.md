title: 'Book Post: The Siren's Call and an Attention Deficit'
---

A friend of mine called Chris Hayes's *The Sirens' Call* exceptionally thoughtful, so I gave it a read. It did not disappoint. The thesis of the book is about the monetization of attention, but this is just a use case for a model the book lays out to understand human attention in general. I'll explain a few things I took away from the book, and then I want to use the framework the book introduces to talk about how I live with ADHD.

The book conceptualizes attention as a data filter. The world is an exceptionally dense data source. Suppose your hat is blown off of your head on a windy day, and you begin chasing the hat across a field past a tree. You could fill an entire hard drive mapping the relative orientations and positions of the individual leaves on the tree based off of your view of it, but you probably won't notice anything about the tree as you run past it other than maybe the fact that the leaves are moving a lot in the wind and the fact that the tree is not in your path. The thing that allows humans to receive stimuli that contain immense amounts of information about the state of the world while actively noticing almost none of it is attention.

I made up that example. Hayes uses the example of a cocktail party to demonstrate three ways that we pay attention to things. I'm going to butcher his nomenclature if I try to remember it, so I'm just going to use my own here, but the examples are his.

1. Directed attention. If you are a guest who is standing in one circle of people listening to a single person talk, you can follow every word that person says. There are many other conversations happening in the party. If you were to try to listen to one of them, you could make out the words they were saying, but you have chosen to listen to this person instead, and so all of the other things you could notice fade into the background.
2. Emergency distraction. If someone drops a stack of plates at the party creating a loud crashing noise, you notice it even if you would have otherwise been focussed on your specific conversation. Conversation pauses because everyone notices it.
3. Social distraction. If someone says your name in a different conversation, you might be pulled away from your current conversation even if you would have otherwise been focussed on your specific conversation. This is remarkable. The sounds which form your name are otherwise indistinguishable from whatever other syllables surround you while being ignored. It shows that your brain must be subconsiously processing every noise you hear just in case your name happens to show up, even as those noises are filtered from your conscious attention.

Hayes uses the emergency siren as an example of an intentional hijacking of the automatic response to an emergency distraction. It is theoretically possible to put yourself in an environment which has so many sirens that you learn to ignore them, but for the most part they succeed at their purpose, which is to make you pay attention to something you would otherwise ignore if you were directing your attention at something else. Driving is an activity which requires a person to filter out almost everything they can see or hear that isn't nearby vehicles and the shape of the road ahead of them. An ambulance siren forces your attention out of that flow state so that you can adjust your driving to make up for an emergency vehicle which needs to break the normal driving patterns you have trained yourself to focus on.

The thing people want from you if they want your attention is your directed attention. The thesis of the book is essentially that distractions are the easiest way to get your attention, so the people who want your directed attention are hijacking your ability to be distracted by emergencies to initially get your attention in the hope that they can get your directed attention once they have your attention at all. However, if you are in a modern location where one person can get your attention, there are probably also other people trying to get your attention there, and so the natural incentives of modernity create information spaces which are full of sirens and flashing lights and garish colors and sheer exhaustion from constantly being distracted.
