title: 'Book Post: Reading Gödel, Escher, Bach while Chatbots Pass the Turing Test'
---

I have been trying to read Douglas Hofstadter's famous book *Gödel, Escher, Bach* for ten years. I decided that I was going to try reading it from the beginning for the third or fourth time a few months ago, and I finally did it. Every time I tried to read it, I found the narrative intellectually compelling and delightfully playful, and yet I would have difficulty picking it up again for some reason. The thing that kept me coming back was the formal logic. I love a surprising logical consequence, and the set theory in the early chapters stoked my curiosity. Intellectually, I wanted to know where the setup of typographical formal systems was going, but I didn't have the willpower to get the words into my brain for the longest time.

The computer science in this book is fifty years out of date, but I think the core insight on minds holds up. In my read, the book is an exploration of the idea that you can build something out of easily understood components on a low level that becomes incomprehensibly tangled up in self-reference but also beautiful or true or functional if understood at a higher level of organization. He has a number of case studies here. The one for which the book is named is Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem. Hofstadter does a masterful job of pointing out the parts of the theorem which are actually clever and glossing over the minute details while still giving some of the structure. Here is an exerpt from the book explaining why Hofstadter went to so much trouble to explain an esoteric mathematics proof in a philosophy of mind book:

>Gödel’s proof offers the notion that a high-level view of a system may contain explanatory power which simply is absent on the lower levels. By this I mean the following. Suppose someone gave you G, Gödel’s undecidable string, as a string of TNT. Also suppose you knew nothing of' Gödel-numbering. The question you are supposed to answer is: "Why isn't this string a theorem of TNT?" Now you are used to such questions; for instance, if you had been asked that question about SO=0, you would have a ready explanation: "Its negation, ~S0=0, is a theorem." This, together with your knowledge that TNT is consistent, provides an explanation of why the given string is a nontheorem. This is what I call an explanation "on the TNT-level"

>The only way to explain G's nontheoremhood is to discover the notion of Gödel-numbering and view TNT on an entirely different level. It is not that it is just difficult and complicated to write out the explanation on the TNT-level; it is impossible. Such an explanation simply does not exist. There is, on the high level, a kind of explanatory power which simply is lacking, in principle, on the TNT-level. G's nontheoremhood is, so to speak, an intrinsically high-level fact.

>Looked at this way, Gödel’s proof suggests-though by no means does it prove!-that there could be some high-level way of viewing the mind/brain, involving concepts which do not appear on lower levels, and that this level might have explanatory power that does not exist-not even in principle-on lower levels. It would mean that some facts could be explained on the high level quite easily, but not on lower levels at all.

Hofstadter has more metaphors. He talks about the genetic code of DNA
