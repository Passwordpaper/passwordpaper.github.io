title: 'Book Post: Reading Gödel, Escher, Bach while Chatbots Pass the Turing Test'
---

Meta-note: I figured out how to put footnotes in my posts. I am become unstoppable rabbithole menace.

I have been trying to read Douglas Hofstadter's famous book *Gödel, Escher, Bach* for ten years. I decided that I was going to try reading it from the beginning for the third or fourth time a few months ago, and I finally did it. Every time I tried to read it, I found the narrative intellectually compelling and delightfully playful, and yet I would have difficulty picking it up again for some reason. The thing that kept me coming back was the formal logic. I love a surprising logical consequence, and the set theory in the early chapters stoked my curiosity. Intellectually, I wanted to know where the setup of typographical formal systems was going, but I didn't have the willpower to get the words into my brain for the longest time.

The computer science in this book is fifty years out of date, but I think the core insight on minds holds up. In my read, the book is an exploration of the idea that you can build something out of easily understood components on a low level that becomes incomprehensibly tangled up in self-reference but also beautiful or true or functional if understood at a higher level of organization. He has a number of case studies here. The one for which the book is named is Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem. Hofstadter does a masterful job of pointing out the parts of the theorem which are actually clever and glossing over the minute details while still giving some of the structure. Here is an exerpt from the book explaining why Hofstadter went to so much trouble to explain an esoteric mathematics proof in a philosophy of mind book:

>Gödel’s proof offers the notion that a high-level view of a system may contain explanatory power which simply is absent on the lower levels. By this I mean the following. Suppose someone gave you G, Gödel’s undecidable string, as a string of TNT[^1].

>The only way to explain G's nontheoremhood is to discover the notion of Gödel-numbering and view TNT on an entirely different level. It is not that it is just difficult and complicated to write out the explanation on the TNT-level; it is impossible. Such an explanation simply does not exist. There is, on the high level, a kind of explanatory power which simply is lacking, in principle, on the TNT-level. G's nontheoremhood is, so to speak, an intrinsically high-level fact.

>Looked at this way, Gödel’s proof suggests-though by no means does it prove!-that there could be some high-level way of viewing the mind/brain, involving concepts which do not appear on lower levels, and that this level might have explanatory power that does not exist-not even in principle-on lower levels. It would mean that some facts could be explained on the high level quite easily, but not on lower levels at all.

I don't know if I buy this! This does not merely assert that consciousness makes far more sense on a higher level of abstraction than the level of raw neurons[^2]. I think he is saying that there are true statements about the arrangement of the physical materials which support consciousness (neurons in a brain for example) that there is no way to explain using only the mechanisms of those materials. I have a couple of metaphors which I will try to use to understand this assertion, and they happen to be things which Hofstadter talks about in the book at length[^3].

1. Machine code is the set of instructions that mechanistically make a computer processor do something. I briefly discuss it [here](https://passwordpaper.com/PyTorch-GPU-API/) in the context of GPU acceleration. It is possible to write an entire computer program in machine code, but nobody does this. Exceptional people code in assembly, which is basically a one-to-one natural language wrapper on machine code. Most people code in a higher language which is run through a compiler or interpreter that turns it into machine code. One thing which is used a lot in programming is a for loop, which is much easier for a human to understand than an incomprehensible string of binary which you feed directly into a wire as changes in voltage, but I don't think it contains any information that the machine code does not. There is still a mechanistic process which leads to a set of actions being carried out. Suppose, as seems likely, that we could make a computer program which is capable of of piloting a robotic body which can do anything a human can do, at least for twenty minutes or so. I'm not saying you couldn't tell it was a machine, but 

2. There is nothing in life which is not downstream of DNA. If you gather up all of the DNA in a cell's mitochondria and nucleus, you have everything you need to create that organism. *Except* that you generally must start with at least one existing cell to read the DNA and turn it into proteins. In practice, many animals also require a mother or other environmental constants for parts of the development process. In theory, the dependence on prior life to propagate life has been violated at least once, but you can take it as given for the past 3 billion years or so. I once tried to make an argument that there is no need to consider explanations of how life evolves which considers things on a lower level than DNA and the protein synthesis chain. Yes, DNA and proteins are made of atoms and you can interact with them as atoms, but I argued that the *explanation* for life was best carried out on the DNA level or higher. In principle, I said, the DNA codes for all of the proteins, so there is a well-founded stack that rests on DNA and adds up to an organism. My wife disabused me of this by talking about epigenetic inheritence. Even without that, one can consider DNA for warm-blooded animals which have live birth. One might think that DNA for an animal which maintains homeostasis rather might be more complicated than that for animals which fluctuate with the environment. However, animals which maintain homeostais can have simpler DNA than other types of organisms because the temperature conditions or whatever can be taken as given. You don't have to code for "what to do if it's 20 degrees out" because the organism develops inside a parent that makes sure that the temperature is steady. Once the organism is developed, it maintains its own homeostasis which the repair and replication chain can depend on. If an alien was handed a human genome with no context, would it be able to infer the process of live birth? I'm not a geneticist; there might be genes which obviously show this is happening. But at least in principle, couldn't genes just code for a weird internal cavity and homeostasis such that one could only *infer* live birth from the *lack* of complicated exception-handling mechanisms for embryonic development? Some extraordinary scientist might theorize that putting the embryo in the cavity would be an elegant explanation for the lack of embryonic environmental exception-handling. This is reasoning far above the level of genes, so maybe this is what Hofstadter is pointing at.

[^1]: TNT is Hofstadter's typographical number theory. He shows earlier in the book how you can encode a small set of basic principles of the natural numbers into a set of typographical rules which let you show things like $$a+b=b+a$$ for any two natural numbers $$a$$ and $$b$$. The upside is that the typographical rules are objective and unambiguous. Some mathematical proofs point at concepts using natural language, and this is one way to avoid the ambiguities inherent in language that can result in apparent paradox or result in a proof which looks like it says one thing but has hidden consequences. One can mechanistically check whether a set of characters is a valid TNT string, and then interpret the string into a statement about the natural numbers.

[^2]: Or other substrates that minds could run on. He does assert elsewhere in the book that minds are best interpretted via higher level "symbols" rather than trying to understand them on the physical level. Ant Fugue is my favorite of the dialogues in the book, and it explores this principle.

[^3]: I would have reached for these examples even if Hofstadter had not. I've literally already written blog posts on this site which use them. Maybe this means that I should not have bothered with the book. Or maybe it means that this book was made for me. Or that I have self-sorted into a group of people who think like me and my individuality is a cherished lie. Who knows?
