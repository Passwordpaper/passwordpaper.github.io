title: Marriage in this Secular Age
---

I got married last year! Many people asked me why. There are answers of much importance to me about how much I love my wife and about my cultural obligations, but I thought I would talk about what marriage means to the capitalist and state institutions which govern my life.

When I got married, I built a strange picture of how the state perceived marriage based off of the requirements. A county issued a license, and a marriage document was to be returned to the state signed by an officiant and two witnesses. The officient could be a judge or a minister, but the state was perfectly happy to call anyone a minister who filled out some paperwork online with one of the many not-for-profit organizations who do that sort of thing. I, being me, read all of the statutes in detail. The statutes mostly were concerned with banning people from marrying twice. So, in summary, the state wants three people to agree that they saw you get married, and they only want you married to one person at a time. They prefer that the marriage ceremony be of religious significance to you, but they really don't want to take responsibility for regulating what counts as religious or equivalent. The first amendment is a marvelous thing.
