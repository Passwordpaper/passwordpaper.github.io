title: Marriage in this Secular Age
---

I got married last year! Many people asked me why. There are boring answers of much importance to me about how much I love my wife and my cultural obligations, but I thought I would talk about what marriage means to the capitalist and state institutions which govern my life.

My understanding is that in the western tradition, marriage was a religious matter that had social implications. Once a priest said you were married, you were married. Aristocrats used it as a way to consolidate political power, but the institution itself built off of its roots in Christianity. Yes there where minority religious groups that had their own traditions, but they were at best tolerated by the majority.
