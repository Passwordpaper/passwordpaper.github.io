I think that organizing my thoughts into moderately coherent paragraphs is a good way to help myself think better. I might post here about anything [except physics](https://quark.rodeo). I'm going to focus on writing more rather than writing well, because I think I'll get better faster that way than if I obsess over posts and rarely publish.
