I think that organizing my thoughts into moderately coherent paragraphs is a good way to help myself think better. I think that social media is a bad place to share thoughts and keep in touch because all of the incentives of the attention economy point to hedonism, poor thinking, and rage. Given all of that, I guess I'm going to start a blog. I might post here about anything [except physics](https://quark.rodeo), but I suspect it will mostly be about books I read and tech stuff I think is cool. I'm going to focus on writing more rather than writing well, because I think I'll get better faster that way than if I obsess over posts and rarely publish.
